Tuple-data-type

This repository consist of information about Tuple collection data type in python.  
Tuple is another simplest form of collection datatype, Tuple is similar to list except it is immutable i.e. it cant be modified or changed. 
All the concepts related with tuple are covered and different built-in methods and functions are also covered.

It consist of description of each topic and several sample program on each topics for practical understanding. 
It comprise of Two folders first one is of Operations on tuples. In that there are several files demonstrating different operations on tuples. 
Operations such as Creating tuples, accessing elements of tuples, traversing tuples, tuple comprehension, and much more. 
The second folder consist of different built-in function and methods on list. Fuctions such as count, max, min, index, sort, insert, zip, remove and much more. 

Along with the sample program, PDF of Hand written note is also availavle for theoretical refernce. 
The note is an attempt to explain the concepts in simple and understanable way. 
So to Understand it more accurately, first go through the theory part and then practice the sample codes and do by your onw also that will help in logic building.
